Nuubz & OAuth2, What Are They?
==============================

Nuubz is website software being developed by me, Raymond C. Rodgers, to provide webcomic creators
an alternative to current mainstream software packages for publishing their work on the web. In order
to provide a great variety of options for account creation for users of all sorts, support for OAuth2
authentication which is supported by Facebook, Google, and other third party services. While OAuth2
is a standard, it's a loose standard at best, with variations from service to service making a single
implementation difficult to create and support for multiple services.

My implementation attempts to solve that issue and I felt it right to share it with whomever would
be interested in using it.

This is a work in progress and may or may not eventually support the full specification (RFC 6749).

If you have questions about either the whole project or the OAuth2 implementation, please visit
