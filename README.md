This repo contains the open sourced portions of the Nuubz software. Information about Nuubz
can be found at https://www.badlucksoft.com and http://www.nuubz.com . This project is still
in early development as of January 2019. Real world work has kind of been slowing me down.

Currently the only open source part of the Nuubz project is the OAuth2 support. Other parts
may come along down the road, but for now, it is becoming a slightly usable subsystem.
